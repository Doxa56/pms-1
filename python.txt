When we want to loop through whole input n and takes n another inputs
for _ in range(n):
  pass


when there is multiple input in one line and we want to give one input to one variable and rest to second then use as below

ex :- Rahul 95 65 79 85
      name, *line = input().split()

      Here first input will go to name and rest of it will assign to *line
