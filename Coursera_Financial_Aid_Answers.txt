Why are you applying for Financial Aid?

I’m a student from India and want to learn Data Science in Python. I think it will be beneficial for my thesis work. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship (about $30 per month). In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn Data science in Python. I am not able to pay this much high fees for this course. Also I am the only boy child of my family who could work for family my other brother, sisters are younger then me. So that's why I want financial aid to support my education. 



How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals?

I want to complete the Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python which is a specialisation course. This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. Also I'll like to be a good data scientist that I can with this course. It will help perform better in carrying out software engineering and give me an edge over my competitors. Also Data science career is at full boom so it also helps me to get this excited opportunity. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
